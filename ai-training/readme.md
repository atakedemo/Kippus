# Cinema Ticket Sales Prediction

## Description
This project consists of a simple linear regression model trained on a cinema ticket sales dataset. The model predicts the total sales based on various factors such as ticket price, occupancy percentage, show time, tickets sold, ticket usage, and capacity.

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cinema-ticket-sales-prediction.git
cd cinema-ticket-sales-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The model will be trained on the dataset, and the prediction result for the total sales will be saved in a JSON file named "output.json".

Please ensure that the JSON input file is in the correct format. It should contain the following features: 'ticket_price', 'occu_perc', 'show_time', 'tickets_sold', 'ticket_use', 'capacity'.
